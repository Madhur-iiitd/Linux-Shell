#Linux Shell Project#
This is a Linux shell project that provides a custom shell environment with several internal and external commands. The shell is designed to run on Linux operating systems and offers extensive error handling and support for flags in the external commands.

#Internal Commands#
The shell includes the following internal commands:

cd: Change the current working directory.
pwd: Print the current working directory.
echo: Display a line of text or the value of a variable.
history: View the command history.
exit: Terminate the shell.
#External Commands#
In addition to the internal commands, the shell implements the following external commands with extensive error handling and support for flags:

ls: List directory contents.
Flags supported: -l (long format), -a (including hidden files), -R (recursively list subdirectories).
cat: Concatenate files and print on the standard output.
Flags supported: -n (number all output lines), -b (number non-empty output lines).
grep: Print lines matching a pattern.
Flags supported: -i (ignore case), -v (invert the match), -r (search recursively in directories).
mkdir: Create directories.
Flags supported: -p (create parent directories if they don't exist).
rm: Remove files and directories.
Flags supported: -r (remove directories and their contents recursively), -f (force deletion without confirmation).
#Usage#
To use the shell, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/linux-shell-project.git.
Change into the project directory: cd linux-shell-project.
Compile the shell: gcc -o shell main.c.
Run the shell: ./shell.
Once the shell is running, you can enter commands, both internal and external, with or without flags, and observe the output. Remember to refer to the provided documentation for the correct syntax and usage of each command.
